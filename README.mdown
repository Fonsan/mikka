# Mikka

Mikka is a thin Ruby wrapper around Akka. It makes Akka's Java API more pleasing to the Rubyist's eye.

## Work in progress

Mikka is a work in progress, but currently used in production. Check out the examples directory for the basics.

It's only tested in JRuby 1.6.2 and Ruby 1.9 mode (add `jruby --1.9` or set `JRUBY_OPTS='--1.9`).

## Mikka?

Mikka is a glacier close to the Akka massive.
